# Air-Quality-Index
As India is developing economy from Industrialization perspective. Development may be good for the nation in terms of GDP and economic gain, but it also has a flipside as more and more industries are being established, they are emitting more smoke, pollutants and Particulate Matter (PM) into the air which is increasing Air pollution. Air Pollution is causing diseases such as Asthma, Lung Cancer and other cardiovascular diseases. Air pollution is being measured by AQI (Air Quality Index) and higher the AQI higher the air pollution. In this project we have analysed the air quality data of major developed/ developing cities in India to find some underlying principles or patterns which will help in predicting the AQI with the data. Since this data was captured at specific intervals over a period of time, we have conducted a Time Series Analysis to predict the AQI of a city at a point in time.
